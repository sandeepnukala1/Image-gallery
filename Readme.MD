# Redfin Image Gallery  

This project was created with pure vanilla JavaScript and CSS styles. 

## How to run the application

To run this app use a chrome webserver and choose this folder, use the port used in the webserver(http://localhost:8887) to hit the main page.

## Technologies Used

* JavaScript
* Chrome webserver
* CSS

## Future Goals

* Make the images load a lot faster, implementing CDN or cache images to remove any delay in loading images. Also adding a video tour of the house (if videos were available)

* The bigger image preview, create next 3 images preview in the bottom and on click, it can change the bigger image preview. 

* Add Redfin based themed css to modals, create next and prev buttons on images.

* Instead of displaying all the images at once, create a paginated view of images to make the application faster. 

* To make everything reusable create a github component library based on Redfin theme. Make css classes reusable also so everyone has the same Image previews across Redfin.
